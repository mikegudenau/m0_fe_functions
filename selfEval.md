# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I am most proud of furthering my userstanding of the functions method. I was having issues with using the return statement. I didn't understand why it was needed. I now understand that the return is used to to make functions more usable outside of the code block inside the curly braces. I'm proud of my stanima and dedication taking breaks when needed. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

Functions are a powerful tool in applications because they allow us to reuse code. Functions provide action to the application, give us the abilty to store parameters, write instructions, and return values based on the instructions. We can then plug in new arguments and this makes the function dynamic, reusable and can be called many times.
